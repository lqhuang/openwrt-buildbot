# Routing and Policy Based Routing

Policy Based Routing (PBR) is a general term for routing techniques that allow
you to make routing decisions based on policies.

PBR could be implemented in multiple levels and multiple ways, such as using
`iproute2` (`ip route`), `netifd`, `nftable` with `fw4` or combination of them
and other app level packages (eg: `pbr`/ `mwan3` / `sing-box` in OpenWRT).

### iproute2

- [Routing basics](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/routing/basics)
  - Note that by default OpenWrt announces IPv6 default route only for GUA and
    applies source filter for IPv6 that allows routing only for prefixes
    delegated from the upstream router.
  - Default routing tables
  - Default routing rules
  - debug routing
    ```sh
    ip address show; ip route show table all
    ip rule show; ip -6 rule show; nft list ruleset
    ```

- [Routing example: PBR with iproute2](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/routing/examples/pbr_iproute2)

### netifd

PBR with `netifd` helps to utilize different routing tables to route traffic to
a specific interface based on traffic parameters like ingress/egress interface,
source/destination address, firewall mark, etc.
